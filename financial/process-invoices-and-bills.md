# Process
1. Pull all bills and invoices from the **Red** folder marked “A/P for QB,” as well as the folder in the bullpen marked “Expense Submission.” These will generally fall into one of three categories: paid/unpaid bills, paid/unpaid contractor invoices or reimbursements
2. Login to Quickbooks Online using the credentials provided, ask Matt Sommer if you do not have them.
3. Select “Expenses” from the left column, then “Vendors” from the top.
4. For each unpaid bill, contractor invoice or reimbursement:
   1. Search for the Vendor, then create a new bill by selecting “New Transaction” in the top right corner, or copying the last bill by opening and selecting copy
   1. Complete the Terms, Bill Date and Due Date, Description, invoice number and Amount fields based on the information provided on the bill, invoice or reimbursement
      1. If a reimbursement, the payment terms should be Net 15
      1. If the payment terms don’t line up with the Due Date, go with the Due Date
   1. Select the proper Account for the transaction based on the Expense Types breakdown below
   1. If related to a particular client account (look for a client code), select that client in the “Client” field. This is particularly important with contractor invoices, 95% of which should be related to a client.
   1. Once the bill is entered, write “In QB” at the top right corner of the bill, invoice or reimbursement form.
1. For each paid bill, find a matching transaction in the “Banking” tab QB and make sure it is properly matched and categorized
1. If you are unsure whether the bill is paid or unpaid, ask the person who submitted it, or Matt Sommer if you are unsure
1. **If it is a bill**
   1. Put in the “To Scan” folder
1. **If it is a contractor invoice:**
   1. Navigate to the BRO Freelance Dashboard
   1. Find the contractor in question on the list and attempt to find the related expense
   1. Mark the cell yellow if it has not been already and enter any key details in the notes if not already completed
   1. If you do not find the expense bring to Matt Sommer
   1. Put invoice in the “To Scan” folder
9. **If it is a reimbursement**
   1. Put in the “To File” folder

## Expense Types
* Contractor expenses - All client contractor expenses go under the “Contractor: “ account, into a sub account denoting the type of work that they did. Use the invoice as guidance, or ask Matt Sommer if you can’t figure out which sub account they belong in.
* General Bills - The majority of bills that come in will we related to general office and operations expenses. Most will pre-populate with the proper account. If not, ask.
* Reimbursements - These will generally either be Sales and Marketing related or general team/professional development related. 
   * Sales & Marketing - These should be marked as either Sales Meeting or Network Event related, which will guide you to either “Sales & Marketing: Sales Meetings” or “Sales & Marketing: Network Events.” If neither, ask.
   * General Team - If for an industry related event that is not sales oriented, they should go under “General & Administrative: Professional Development”, otherwise “General & Administrative: Travel and Ent”

*Have any questions? Don’t hesitate to ask!*
