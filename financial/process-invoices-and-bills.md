# Process
1. Pull all bills and invoices from the **Red** folder marked “A/P for QB,” as well as the folder in the bullpen marked “Expense Submission.” These will generally fall into one of three categories: paid/unpaid bills, paid/unpaid contractor invoices or reimbursements
2. Login to Quickbooks Online using the credentials provided, ask Matt Sommer if you do not have them.
3. Select “Expenses” from the left column, then “Vendors” from the top.
4. For each unpaid bill, contractor invoice or reimbursement:
					a. search for the Vendor, then create a new bill by selecting “New Transaction” in the top right corner, or copying the last bill by opening and selecting copy
					b. Complete the Terms, Bill Date and Due Date, Description, invoice number and Amount fields based on the information provided on the bill, invoice or reimbursement
i. If a reimbursement, the payment terms should be Net 15
If the payment terms don’t line up with the Due Date, go with the Due Date
Select the proper Account for the transaction based on the Expense Types breakdown below
If related to a particular client account (look for a client code), select that client in the “Client” field. This is particularly important with contractor invoices, 95% of which should be related to a client.
Once the bill is entered, write “In QB” at the top right corner of the bill, invoice or reimbursement form.
For each paid bill, find a matching transaction in the “Banking” tab QB and make sure it is properly matched and categorized
If you are unsure whether the bill is paid or unpaid, ask the person who submitted it, or Matt Sommer if you are unsure
**If it is a bill**
Put in the “To Scan” folder
**If it is a contractor invoice:**
Navigate to the BRO Freelance Dashboard
Find the contractor in question on the list and attempt to find the related expense
Mark the cell yellow if it has not been already and enter any key details in the notes if not already completed
If you do not find the expense bring to Matt Sommer
Put invoice in the “To Scan” folder
**If it is a reimbursement**
Put in the “To File” folder
