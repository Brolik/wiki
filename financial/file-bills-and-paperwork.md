# Process
## Scanning
1. Take the “To Scan” folder from the in/out box
1. Log into Neat Online (ask Matt Sommer for the credentials), and open the folder called Brolik Library (original) if it doesn’t open automatically. Then make sure the scanner is turned on.
1. Select a document. Navigate to the Documents folder, then look for the general folder in which your document belongs:
   * Legal Documents -> All legal oriented contracts and documents that aren’t client project contracts, incl. NDAs, corporate docs etc.
   * Financial Documents -> All bills and statements
   * Contracts -> All client project related contracts, including service agreements and SOWs
   * HR/Employee Paperwork -> All employee and subcontractor related paperwork including contracts & invoices for contractors and contracts, benefits and legal docs for employees
1. Once you have found and selected the proper folder (if you cannot find it, ask Matt Sommer), select the proper scan settings from the dropdown in the top left (separate or combined pages, and single or double sided?)
1. Place the document on the scanner and press scan, either on the unit or in the application
1. When each document is scanned, place the hard copy into the “To File” folder


### For checks and check stubs
*These are left until the end of the month in which they were received/paid*

1. A/R Checks and Stubs
   1. Separate A/R stack into checks and stubs
   1. Arrange each stack into chronological order based on the date of the check

   1. Navigate to Documents > Financial Documents > Check Stubs > Receivable stubs > the folder for the current year
   1. Scan each stack of checks and stubs into its own .pdf, and name according to the naming convention
   1. Shred the checks and staple each stack of stubs, then place them in the “to file” folder
