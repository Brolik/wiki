1. Click on the last invoice sent, and when open select the Copy command from the bottom of the screen
1. Once the invoice is copied, update the send date, due date terms and line items according to the dashboard (if you are unsure about which account the invoice belongs in, ask Matt Sommer)
1. Save and close the invoice, look at the invoice number from the last invoice sent to this client, then reopen the invoice and enter the correct invoice number
