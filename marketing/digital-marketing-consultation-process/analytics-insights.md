# Example Insights Report
## Target Audience Demographics
Although the Target Audience as defined in *|CLIENT|*’s brand strategy is “People of all ages, men & women... the young & the young at heart”, their current visitor base actually skews older (45+) and much more towards men (80%). 

Despite these disparities, the transactions do distribute more normally across these demographics, specifically when looking at gender. There’s clear opportunity here then in evaluating both *|CLIENT|*’s targeting parameters for PPC campaigns and their messaging. 

## Organic Traffic/SEO
This is one of the most valuable channels for *|CLIENT|* in terms of quality metrics, on-site conversion rate, and ecommerce transaction volume. However, it trails Paid Search, Direct, and Social traffic in terms of volume. With focused keyword optimization, targeted content development, implementation of Search Console, and inbound link building strategies, *|CLIENT|* can improve on their current organic Domain Authority of 12, allowing them to capture more of this high value audience.

## Goals & Events
Currently, *|CLIENT|* has all of their primary business goals (ex. Add to Carts, Initiate Checkout) set up as events in Analytics. This makes attribution difficult across channels, audiences, content, etc., so their Analytics Goal Structure should be reorganized.

## Return Visitors
Return visitors have generated 60% of all transactions at a substantially higher conversion rate than new visitors, indicating that a retargeting campaign centered on a tested customer funnel for social and GDN could provide an enormous benefit.

## Mobile Experience
Traffic from mobile makes up 48% of all traffic, the majority of which are first time visitors to the site. However engagement metrics from mobile users are substantially worse than desktop, indicating that the mobile user experience and responsive design of the site should be evaluated for improvements.

* Mobile - 1.9 Pages per Session, 01:16 Average Session Duration, 63% Bounce Rate, 4 Transactions
* Desktop - 3.3 Pages per Session, 03:35 Average Session Duration, 36% Bounce Rate, 24 Transactions

## PPC Campaigns
Despite the high volume and decent quality metrics from *|CLIENT|*’s current Adwords and Social campaigns, both of these channels are generating conversion rates at or below 0.05%. With all other channels generating conversion rates at or above 0.5%, there is a  clear opportunity here to test and subsequently optimize these paid campaigns to align more closely with *|CLIENT|*’s ideal customer and therefore maximize their digital ad spend.  

## Google Shopping
A channel that *|CLIENT|* is not currently exploring despite competitors being present in is the Google Shopping network. SERP’s for electric bicycle keywords are crowded with Adwords, local packs, and Shopping Ads, so it’s imperative that *|CLIENT|*’s campaigns are maximizing the amount of territory the brand occupies on these results pages.

## Landing Page Improvements
The second highest common landing page, behind only the homepage, is ____. While there is valuable testimonial content here, it’s not an ideal first digital experience with the brand, as indicated by its 78% bounce rate and 39 second average session duration. Landing pages such as these should be evaluated with heat map data and UX expertise to encourage further engagement with the *|CLIENT|* brand via strategic calls to action and improved content.

## Adwords
*|CLIENT|*’s only currently active ad group is a set of branded terms that provides moderate amounts of traffic. Previously they launched an unbranded campaign but ran into a highly competitive space that ate up their budget at a +90% lost impression share when looking at all-time data. 

With so much competition, this is clearly a valuable space for *|CLIENT|* to be involved in. However, extensive optimizations will need to be made between the target keywords, strategic bid adjustments, and landing page experiences to maximize the effectiveness of the campaign.
