## Introduction and Strategy Workshop Prep


Hi *|POC|*,

Looking forward to our Strategy Workshop on Thursday! There are a few things we like to get started before the meeting to ensure that we are all prepared and can move as efficiently as possible. 

**Pre-meeting Questionnaire**
We have a quick questionnaire for you to fill out before the meeting that will help us all come to the meeting a little bit more prepared. Don’t spend too much time thinking about the answers to these questions, they should only take 20-30 minutes to complete.

Questionnaire Link

**Customer List**
It would be great to get a head start in collecting potential interview candidates for our Target Audience Analysis, as this is one of the most time consuming parts of our research. If you could provide us with a list of 10-15 of your current/past customers that you think would be beneficial for us to speak to, that would be great. We usually don't get responses from everyone, so the more people we reach out to, the more chance of us getting interviews. 

Please include in the list:
Client name
Contact info (email and phone # if possible)
Any demographic information that you think might be helpful
Acquisition path, if known

Other than that, just come ready to think strategically and creatively about your business and marketing approach! Let me know if you have any questions or concerns, otherwise I look forward to seeing you guys Thursday!

Thanks!

## Stakeholders Workshop Followup

Hi *|POC|*, 

Thank you for your time today. We're excited to dig in!

I've attached the whiteboard pictures from our meeting and provided a link to the competitive matrix we reviewed. As mentioned, we'd like to speak with a few of your customers from each of the audience segments we outlined: 
Project managers/engineers
Construction company owner/operators
Project management support staff

If you can provide us with a list of 3-5 current/past customers from each group for us to speak with, that would be great. We usually don't get responses from everyone, so the more people we reach out to, the better chance we have of getting the interviews we need. 

Please include in the list:
Client name
Contact info (email and phone # if possible)
Any demographic information that would be helpful
Acquisition path, if known

In terms of what these people can expect, we generally hold our interviews by phone and they take about 15-20 minutes. We also like to record the interviews themselves so that we can reference them as we work through our process.

Finally, you can expect to receive a Goals and KPIs overview from us this week!

Thanks,

## Goals and KPIs delivery
Hi *|POC|*, 

I have attached our first deliverable, the Goals and KPIs.

This document lays out our understanding of the goals for this project based on our initial conversations with your team, along with a breakdown of the metrics that we will use to define success for each goal.

Once you have reviewed this document, we would like to jump on a call with you next week to briefly discuss  and make sure that we are on the same page. If any changes come out of this discussion, we will update the document and deliver an updated version. Let me know when you are available for a quick call in the next few days. 

Thanks, and let me know if you have any questions!
