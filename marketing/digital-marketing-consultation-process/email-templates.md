# Introduction and Strategy Workshop Prep


Hi *|POC|*,

Looking forward to our Strategy Workshop on Thursday! There are a few things we like to get started before the meeting to ensure that we are all prepared and can move as efficiently as possible. 

**Pre-meeting Questionnaire**
We have a quick questionnaire for you to fill out before the meeting that will help us all come to the meeting a little bit more prepared. Don’t spend too much time thinking about the answers to these questions, they should only take 20-30 minutes to complete.

Questionnaire Link

**Customer List**
It would be great to get a head start in collecting potential interview candidates for our Target Audience Analysis, as this is one of the most time consuming parts of our research. If you could provide us with a list of 10-15 of your current/past customers that you think would be beneficial for us to speak to, that would be great. We usually don't get responses from everyone, so the more people we reach out to, the more chance of us getting interviews. 

Please include in the list:
Client name
Contact info (email and phone # if possible)
Any demographic information that you think might be helpful
Acquisition path, if known

Other than that, just come ready to think strategically and creatively about your business and marketing approach! Let me know if you have any questions or concerns, otherwise I look forward to seeing you guys Thursday!

Thanks!

# Stakeholders Workshop Followup

Hi *|POC|*, 

Thank you for your time today. We're excited to dig in!

I've attached the whiteboard pictures from our meeting and provided a link to the competitive matrix we reviewed. As mentioned, we'd like to speak with a few of your customers from each of the audience segments we outlined: 
Project managers/engineers
Construction company owner/operators
Project management support staff

If you can provide us with a list of 3-5 current/past customers from each group for us to speak with, that would be great. We usually don't get responses from everyone, so the more people we reach out to, the better chance we have of getting the interviews we need. 

Please include in the list:
Client name
Contact info (email and phone # if possible)
Any demographic information that would be helpful
Acquisition path, if known

In terms of what these people can expect, we generally hold our interviews by phone and they take about 15-20 minutes. We also like to record the interviews themselves so that we can reference them as we work through our process.

Finally, you can expect to receive a Goals and KPIs overview from us this week!

Thanks,

# Goals and KPIs delivery
Hi *|POC|*, 

I have attached our first deliverable, the Goals and KPIs.

This document lays out our understanding of the goals for this project based on our initial conversations with your team, along with a breakdown of the metrics that we will use to define success for each goal.

Once you have reviewed this document, we would like to jump on a call with you next week to briefly discuss  and make sure that we are on the same page. If any changes come out of this discussion, we will update the document and deliver an updated version. Let me know when you are available for a quick call in the next few days. 

Thanks, and let me know if you have any questions!

# Brand Presence Audit Delivery
Hey *|POC|*, 

I have attached, for your reading pleasure, the second deliverable in our Digital Marketing Consultation process, the Brand Presence Audit.

The goal of the Brand Presence Audit is to gauge how *|CLIENTS|* brand, marketing and digital presence stands against those of its competitors, and to begin identifying areas of opportunity for us to include in the Digital Marketing Launch Plan.

Once you have reviewed this document, we’d love to hop on a call to discuss and answer any questions you may have. Let me know when you are available over the next few business days so that we can get something on the calendar.

We plan to deliver the Target Audience Analysis next week as well, but we are hoping to get a few more interviews done before we wrap things up. I’m hoping these will go smoothly so that we have a nice variety of perspectives to include in our analysis. We’ll be in touch next week about our progress.

Thanks, and have a great weekend!

# Target Audience Delivery
Hey *|POC|*,

Happy Friday! I have some more reading material for you and your team. Attached here is the third deliverable in our consultation process - the Target Audience Analysis.

As you know, we have been working diligently on this report, which serves to paint a picture of your individual audience segments, their respective decision maker values, and how these align with their perception of */CLIENTS/* brand.

Similar to the Brand Presence Audit, we'd like to schedule a call next week to go over this report once you've had a chance to review its contents. Let me know if there are any particular days/times that work best for you.

Following this, the last piece of our consultation process is the Digital Marketing Campaign Rollout, which will pull the learnings from all of our deliverables into an actionable marketing plan. We're currently on track to have this over to you within the next two weeks.

Thanks and enjoy your weekend!
